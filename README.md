# Logifi-Core
The open-source core digital flight logbook used by Logifi.io. Community driven, pilot focused.  

This is very early on in the Product creation stage of Logifi and I am opening it up to the community of pilots and coders alike to help build something that people will use.  

Currently using the framework vue.js and there is no backend connected so everything is stored locally.  I want to get the product working before I add a backend (login, database, etc).  

This is building a project but it also is for building a network. I plan to add many features to this logbook and will need more solid teammates on the journey to bring forward some new tech to the average pilot. If that is something that interests anyone on here then I would love to have a chat.

This Discord will be where the community talks to eachother and builds of off one another.  

The website is posted on the page www.logifi.io but that is a fork that I have created.  Logifi-Core is the open source code that I am using for the logbook.  Still very much a work in progress.  

For starters, I think it would be focused at airline pilots who don't necessarily need to have someone sign an entry every time.  Just have the capabilities of adding entries (eventually bulk) and automated time totaling.  

For now you will have to run the code your own but I am going for one of the main Saas themes that I am seeing out there.  Similar to Robinhood or CFO Silvia.  A dashboard at the top with totals and customization, a panel on the side for specifics, and more information as you scroll down.
